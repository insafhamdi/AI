        "\n",
        "1. **Text Preprocessing**:\n",

        "*a. Standard steps:*\n",
        "   - Tokenization: Splitting text into individual words or tokens.\n",
        "   - Lowercasing: Converting all text to lowercase for consistency.\n",
        "   - Stopword Removal: Removing common words (e.g., \"and,\" \"the\") that do not carry significant meaning.\n",
        "   - Punctuation Removal: Removing punctuation marks.\n",
        "   - Spell Correction: Correcting common spelling errors.\n",

        "*b. Text Cleaning:*\n",
        "   - Removing HTML tags, special characters, or unwanted symbols.\n",
        "   - Handling contractions (e.g., \"I'm\" to \"I am\").\n",
        "   - Removing or replacing URLs, email addresses, and other sensitive information.\n",
        "\n",
        "*c. Text Normalization:*\n",
        "   - Stemming: Reducing words to their root form (e.g., \"running\" to \"run\").\n",
        "   - Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base or dictionary form (e.g., \"better\" to \"good\").\n",

        "   - Bag of Words (BoW): Creating a matrix of word frequencies or presence/absence.\n",
        "   - Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF): Assigning weights to words based on their importance in a document.\n",
        "   - Word Embeddings: Representing words as dense vector representations (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).\n",
        "   - Named Entity Recognition (NER):  Identifying and classifying entities (e.g., names of people, organizations, locations) in text.\n",
        "   - Part-of-Speech Tagging (POS): Assigning grammatical tags (e.g., noun, verb, adjective) to words in a sentence. These POS tags can be used as features, especially in syntactic or grammatical analysis tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Modeling**:  \n",
        "    - building and training machine learning or deep learning models to perform specific natural language processing tasks\n",
        "    - selecting an appropriate model architecture\n",
        "    - training the model on labeled data\n",
